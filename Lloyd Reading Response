Perspective Question: In the Lloyd et al. article, the authors introduce a method that uses a matter of diffferent openly available
geospatial datasets in order to produce high resolution, global gridded descriptions of human populations. Describe the geospatial datasets
the authors are using in their methodology. How is their method an improvementw hen compared to a conventional census? Are you able to 
describe how the authros use a number of different geospaital layers with their data science method in order to produce a high resolution,
global gridded descriptoin of human population?

Response: 
In order to produce such high resolution, global gridded descriptions of human populations, the authors describe how WorldPop manages to 
provide satellite data at 3 arc seconds (about 100m at the equator) as well at 30 arc seconds (approximately 1 kilometer at the equator).
