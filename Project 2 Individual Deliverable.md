These graphs represent predictions of Cuba's population density based on differing covariates. Several covariates—which make predictions of population counts in specified regions based on specific landmarks or traits seen in acquired satellite images—were used in this project. The top graph represents an overlap of a histogram and density plot showing how the covariates of water, topography, slope, and night-time lights, while the bottom graph uses several dst covariates, which include herbaceous cover, and urban and bare areas. The 168 municipalities of Cuba are represented in these graphs. Population counts are modified with a log function so as to reduce the effect of any one outlier that may have a significantly higher or lower population count than the rest of the municipalities.
