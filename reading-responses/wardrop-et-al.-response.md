**Perspective Question:** In the reading for today, the authors \(Wardrop et al.\) introduce a top-down approach as well as a bottom-up approach. Describe each of these two methods. Compare and contrast them with one another. What advantages do these new methodologies present when compared to past approaches? Are you able to provide an example of each \(bonus\)?

**Response:** The authors present two alternate methods of disaggregation: an extensive top-down approach as well as a cheaper bottom-up approach. The top-down approach entails data that is acquired at a large scale which is then used alongside ancillary or "covariate" data to define a functional relationship between the data sets, in the case of the article, between population density and mapped ancillary data. The bottom-up approach follows a different route in that small-scale data is combined to generate a generalized pattern from which predictions can be made. 

The top-down approach requires that extensive data collection takes place, potentially in the form of an expensive national census. Many nations that don't have the money and resources to collect such comprehensive data may instead adopt a bottom-up system with microcensus', wherein data from several partial census' is combined to create data to the same effect. The bottom-up approach can prove to be much more economical when compared to past approaches, and the bottom-up approach being utilized as a complementary data set to the top-down approach can greatly increase the accuracy of the data.
