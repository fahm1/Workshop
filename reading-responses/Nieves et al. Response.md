# Nieves et al. Reading Response

## Questions:

Nieves et al. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?  Describe in detail how random forest works.  What is a dasymmetric population allocation? Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside? 

Nieves et al. focused on determining population density values globally, as they recognized the requirements to facilitate "public
health, sustainability and policy planning in general," in a greater global population that is expected to arise. 

Random forests are a machine learning method utilized when attempting to classify data or observations. Each random forest is composed of several decision trees, which split up the data into several subgroups such that the resultant groups are as different from each other as possible. The random forest brings together each individual decision tree, and the decision tree that is most common among the several trees is the one that is used as a final model. In this way, only the most accurate model is chosen, as each decision tree in this way protects each other tree's validity. As this machine learning method 'learns' how to separate the population in the most efficient approach possible, it may make random forests superior to standard prediction models (eg linear regression models). 

Dasymetric population allocation concerns using aggregated data--such as in the form of census data--and combines it with ancillary data to create a more accurate model that reflects real-world values with greater precision. This ancillary data typically comes from satellite data, which can improve on standard census data as it provides more detail as to where a population may exist and where some populations may not exist. 

Nieves lists the 5 most important covariates in terms of greater population prediction accuracy starting with "urban/suburban extents," going down to "environment and urban/suburban proxies...climatic/environmental variables...populated place covariates...and transportation networks."
