# Final Project Deliverable: Cuba

## Political Subdivisions

![](Cuba_Plotf.png)


The nation of Cuba is divided into 15 provinces (adm1) and 168 municipalities (adm2) within those provinces. The capital, La Havana, lies in the northwest in a densely populated region. Throughout these projects, I have focused primarily on the Holguin and Santiago de Cuba provinces, both of which lie in the southeast. The Holguin prvoince directly borders the Atlantic Ocean to the north, while the Santiago de Cuba province directly borders the Caribbean Sea to the south. I also went deeper into the Holguin province in order to analyze the Mayari and Banes municipalities. The data behind these boundaries was dated for 2020 and sourced from GADM.

## Population Analysis

![](Cuba.png)

The plot above is a population density map and bar graph for Cuba in 2020. Both the map and bar graph are specific to the first administrative level in Cuba: the provinces. Both representations of population data also show the percent of the total population living within each individual province both by percent/numerical values, as well as by color, with a legend on the right defining the colors. As of 2018, the total population of Cuba is estimated to be 11.34 million (World Bank, U.S. Census Bureau). By both the map and graph, it is apparent that there is a spike in population in the northwest in the province of Ciudad de la Habana, which is where slightly over 2 million people as well as the nation's capital reside. The bar graph also shows that the provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Holguin are the second and third most populated provinces respectively.
